# JHAP Templates

Contains the [pandoc](https://pandoc.org) templates used by the [*Journal for the History of Analytical Philosophy*](https://jhaponline.org) to create its output PDF, ePub and HTML files.

It is structured to serve as the target of pandoc’s `--data-dir` option.

It also contains images/resources used by the templates and thus could also serve as the target of pandoc’s `--resource-path` option.

Finally it backs up the settings file `project-settings.json` used by the [Open Guide Typesetting Framework](https://github.com/frabjous/open-guide-typesettings-framework) for JHAP.
